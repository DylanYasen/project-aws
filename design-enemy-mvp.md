### **1. Packet Swarm**
**Theme**: A chaotic, disruptive swarm that interferes with the player’s strategy.

| **Move**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fragmentation**    | Splits into a smaller swarm with half HP upon taking damage, creating a chain of weaker enemies. |
| **Signal Jamming**   | Increases the energy cost of a random card in the player’s hand by +1 for one turn. |
| **Swarm Protect**    | Gains a small amount of block (e.g., 10) when another ally is damaged, simulating a defensive swarm behavior. |
| **Swarm Amplify**    | If paired with another enemy, increases its damage output slightly for each living ally (e.g., +2 damage per enemy). |

---

### **2. Malicious Bot**
**Theme**: A calculated and obstructive enemy that sets traps and debuffs players.

| **Move**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trap Deploy**      | Applies a “Trapped” debuff to a random card, increasing its energy cost by +1 for one turn. |
| **Defensive Protocol** | Gains block and taunts the player (must be targeted first for the next turn). |
| **Claw Strike**      | Deals moderate damage and applies a minor debuff, reducing block gain by 25% for one turn. |
| **Overload Trap**    | If defeated, deals AoE damage (e.g., 15) to all players, simulating an explosive failsafe. |

---

### **3. Overloaded Virus**
**Theme**: A slow, powerful threat that applies stacking debuffs and pressures players over time.

| **Move**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Corruption Spread** | Deals low AoE damage (e.g., 5 to all) and applies a stacking debuff reducing the player’s damage output by 10% per stack. |
| **System Crash**     | Deals heavy single-target damage (e.g., 20) after a two-turn charge-up period. |
| **Glitch Pulse**     | Randomly disables one card in the player’s hand for the next turn. |
| **Viral Rebound**    | When damaged, applies a minor debuff (e.g., -1 energy regen) to the attacker for one turn. |

### **Synergy and Variation**
- **Packet Swarm + Malicious Bot**: A disruptive encounter where Packet Swarm interferes with energy costs while Malicious Bot restricts specific card plays.
- **Overloaded Virus + Packet Swarm**: A compounding threat where the Virus applies stacking debuffs, and Packet Swarm creates energy disruptions.
- **All Three Together**: An advanced encounter where Malicious Bot traps cards, Packet Swarm disrupts energy, and Overloaded Virus applies cumulative debuffs.
