|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Packet Swarm**      | 50             | Fragile to encourage splitting mechanics (**Fragmentation**) but dangerous in numbers. |
| **Malicious Bot**     | 80             | Durable enough to lay traps and debuffs, requiring sustained attention.          |

| **Malicious Bot**     | 80             | Moderate HP to stay alive and disrupt player strategies.                         |
| **Overloaded Virus**  | 100            | Significant HP for a strong debuffing and AoE enemy.                             |
| **SEV3**              | 70             | Medium HP to reflect its role as a medium-priority threat.                       |

### **Rationale**:
1. **Boss**: High HP to create an endurance challenge.  
2. **Elites**: Moderate to high HP, giving them time to apply complex mechanics.  
3. **Normals**: Lower HP to keep fights short but engaging, with mechanics creating most of the challenge.
